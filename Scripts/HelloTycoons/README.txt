# Hello Tycoons

## ❓ Description

A minimal example script for OpenTTD Game Scripts, designed to showcase how to send messages and interact with the game world in multiple ways. It’s ideal as a **starting point** or **template** for new Game Script developers.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✔️ Logs a message via `GSLog`
- ✔️ Posts a general news item to all players
- ✔️ Places a sign in the centre of the map
- ✔️ Renames the first company to `"Hello Tycoon Company"`

---

## 🧠 How It Works

When the script starts, it executes a `PostInit()` function that:
1. Sends `"Hello Tycoons!"` to the game log using `GSLog.Info()`
2. Posts the same message to the in-game news feed using `GSNews.Create()`
3. Places a sign in the middle of the map using `GSSign.BuildSign()`
4. Renames the first company (if it exists) using `GSCompany.SetName()`

These actions use core OpenTTD GameScript functions like `GSMap`, `GSText`, and `GSCompanyMode`.

## 📦 What's It For?

This script is best suited for:
- Learning the basics of OpenTTD GameScript development
- Testing message output and map interaction features
- Creating a personal Game Script template or boilerplate
- Demonstrating community mods or beginner tutorials

## 🔧 Installation
1. Place the `HelloTycoons` folder into your `OpenTTD\content_download\game` directory
2. Launch OpenTTD → Game Script Settings → Select Game Script → Choose **Hello Tycoons**
3. Start a new game — you’ll see greetings appear automatically:
   - In the game log
   - As a pop-up news item
   - As a sign in the middle of the map
   - (Optional) As the name of the first company
