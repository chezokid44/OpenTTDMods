# MH Cargo Tracker

## Description

Cargo Tracker is a Game Script for OpenTTD that measures how much of a chosen cargo type each company delivers.  
The amount is tracked for the town nearest to that company’s headquarters, and the results are displayed in a league table.

## Features

- Automatic league table ranking companies by delivered cargo
- Tracks deliveries to the town closest to each company HQ
- Configurable cargo type (set via script settings)
- Save/load support – continues tracking across saved games

## How It Works

- Each in-game month, the script checks every company’s HQ
- It finds the nearest town to that HQ
- Using the cargo monitor, it calculates how much of the chosen cargo was delivered there
- The totals are added to each company’s score and shown in a league table
- If companies appear, go bankrupt, or merge, their entries are updated automatically
