# Evil Fish Death Tracker

## Description

## A fun script which displays a news article each year with the number of evil fish which have been killed by bombing river tiles

## Features

## News article shown each year with the number of evil fish killed

## How It Works

On initial game launch, add all river tiles to a list.
Each year check if each tile in the list is still a river tile.
For each one which is no longer a river tile, remove it from the list and increase the number of evil fish killed (1-10 per tile).
If the single-width setting is enabled (on by default), surrounding tiles are checked so that only single-width rivers are considered for evil fish.
